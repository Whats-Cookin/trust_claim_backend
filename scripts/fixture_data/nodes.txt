On the 3rd of March 2024, I visited AMURT in Ebonyi, Nigeria to check out the facilities and work they do. I was blowed away by their achievement due the way they converted health centers to a mini hospital. I spoke with some beneficiary of this project and not only them but the community has been glad since the beginning of the project.

My name is Ani Peter Benjamin, and I am a software engineer with the LinkedTrust team. In early May 2024, I traveled to Ebonyi State with Orjiene Kenechukwu to observe the remarkable work being done by AMURT in the community. As a Nigerian, I am delighted to see the significant improvements in underdeveloped communities.
AMURT's strategies to combat poverty in rural areas, such as providing innovative cooperative ideas, have greatly assisted local women in taking better care of their families. Additionally, AMURT has established awareness groups to educate women on proper childbearing practices and to engage the youth in educational initiatives.
The impact of AMURT's efforts on Ebonyi State has been profoundly positive, especially in their health centers. I am personally impressed and supportive of the progress they have made.|https://trustclaims-images.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/IMG_20240503_130439.jpeg|
