My name is Ani Peter Benjamin, and I am a software engineer with the LinkedTrust team. In early May 2024, I traveled to Ebonyi State with Orjiene Kenechukwu to observe the remarkable work being done by AMURT in the community. As a Nigerian, I am delighted to see the significant improvements in underdeveloped communities.

AMURT's strategies to combat poverty in rural areas, such as providing innovative cooperative ideas, have greatly assisted local women in taking better care of their families. Additionally, AMURT has established awareness groups to educate women on proper childbearing practices and to engage the youth in educational initiatives.

The impact of AMURT's efforts on Ebonyi State has been profoundly positive, especially in their health centers. I am personally impressed and supportive of the progress they have made.

Peter and I visited AMURT in Ebonyi, Nigeria, representing Voice of a Child via LinkedTrust. We were warmly welcomed by Dada. During our visit, we met with key individuals including Dada, Peter, the COO, and heads of various departments. We learned about their collaboration with the Government and Community to provide high-quality healthcare services, especially focusing on maternal and child health. Our visit to health centers showcased their dedication. We spoke with beneficiaries and learned about the impact of AMURT's initiatives, including economic empowerment through cooperative management schemes and increased healthcare utilization rates through outreach efforts. AMURT's holistic approach includes surgical interventions for children. Our visit left us inspired by their commitment to transforming lives, and we anticipate continued collaboration in advancing healthcare and socioeconomic development in Ebonyi and beyond.
